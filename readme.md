# DolDoc parser
Parses DolDocs. Works for a good portion of DolDoc elements. However it is still very much a WIP, and will probably be restructured to be less of a mess in the future. 
But if you need to parse DolDoc for whatever reason, this might be able to get you somewhere.

May eventually turn into a full python library for interfacing with TempleOS related files.
